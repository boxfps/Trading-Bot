To keep the bot simple, I will be mostly trading natural resources stocks as
they are quite a lot on the TSX (you can adjust based on your market).

I will also be taking a very very safe approach to my trading strategy. Attempting to
minimize risks, even if it means less overall returns.

# TLDR ---------------------------------------
Summary
Entry: Buy when the 20-day EMA crosses above the 50-day EMA, confirmed by volume and price action.
Exit: Sell when the 20-day EMA crosses below the 50-day EMA, using stop-loss and take-profit orders for risk management.
Risk Management: Implement position sizing, diversification, and regular strategy reviews to minimize risks.
----------------------------------------------

I will be implementing a Moving Averages (MA) approach.
