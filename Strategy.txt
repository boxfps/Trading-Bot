To keep the bot simple, I will be mostly trading natural resources stocks as
they are quite a lot on the TSX (you can adjust based on your market).

I will also be taking a very very safe approach to my trading strategy. Attempting to
minimize risks, even if it means less overall returns.

# TLDR ---------------------------------------
Summary
Entry: Buy when the 20-day EMA crosses above the 50-day EMA, confirmed by volume and price action.
Exit: Sell when the 20-day EMA crosses below the 50-day EMA, using stop-loss and take-profit orders for risk management.
Risk Management: Implement position sizing, diversification, and regular strategy reviews to minimize risks.
----------------------------------------------

I will be implementing a very simple Moving Averages (MA) approach.

1 - My Objectives
    - Automatic trades
        - Kind of the point of having a bot do it for you!
    - Return ~5% or higher on a monthly basis
        - Over time I would like to make this closer to 10% as I refine my strategy and make the code better.
2 - My indicators
    - Buy when the 20 day EMA crosses above the 50 day EMA (bullish)
        - Will run some arithmetic to find when the 20 day Exponential Moving Average
        crosses above the 50 day EMA indicating a rise in stock price overtime. This
        will help the bot decided when to buy. Probably will run the arithmetic every 10 minutes
        or less depending on hardware restrictions.

    - Sell when the 20 Day EMA crosses below the 50 day EMA (bearish)
        - Will sell the stock if the 20 day Exponential Moving Average falls below the 50 
        day EMA, this is indicating a fall in the stock price is coming. Both buy and sell indicators 
        will be calculated at the same time.

3.1 - Entry Criteria
    - Buy signal: EMA bullish crossover
        - Relatively straight forward idea, buy when the math believes the stock to be rising. I will
        enter to the trade with no more than 2% of my total capital (subject to change).
    - Confirm with a volume and trend check
        - I will run some validation before the bot buys to ensure it is not a false positive on the EMA. 
        I will do this using some other math regarding the movement in price historically and that day. 

3.2 - Exit Criteria
    - Sell signal: EMA bearish crossover
        - Again simple strategy, sell when the math seems to be saying it is going down. I may tweak
        this overtime to try and account for volatility
    - Set stop loss orders to minimize losses
        - I would like to lose >10% per trade at most. Will have to tweak the number overtime with experience. 
    - Set take profit to secure profits
        - Still undecided about this idea. I would like it to execute the trades for safety and security
        but if I sell at one point and it continues to skyrocket higher. I will lose out. Need to implement 
        a check for that. 
    - Optionally set up time based exits
        - I do not know if I will implement this. But it is not a bad idea if I want to make more short term trades.
4 - Risk Management
    - Using no more than 2% of my capital per trade (adjust as needed)
        - Given I have a smaller account and am trading less stock. I may up this number and use more % capital. 
    - Diversify (use more than one stock or sector)
        - Currently using ~10 stocks on 2 different secotrs. Will look to diversify this more in the future. 
    - Check on the bot regularily to ensure I dont need to make changes
        - Most likely will make a habit of periodically checking throughout the week and making tweaks to 
        the bot on weekends when the markets are closed.
