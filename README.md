# VERY IMPORTANT NOTE
I am not a financial expert, I am doing this at my own risk using a strategy I develop. Please do not take my strategy or anything I say in the document(s) as advice. 

If you wish to invest, I encourage you to do your own research or speak to a professional. 

# Trading-Bot
My (probably poor) attempt at creating a trading bot. Primarily in python. I will do my best to document the code and keep it readble, although this is my first public project. 

# The Goal of this project
My goal in doing this project is to create a automatic trading bot, that can consistently return 5% on a monthly basis. I will not be options trading (yet) and will purely be buying and selling stocks. 

To understand more about my strategy, please see Strategy.txt


# October 12th 2024
Today I have simply organized my files, and grabbed a random list of stocks to trade. I will most likely be updating these in the future. 

I have also begun to define my trading strategy, based on many many hours of research done before beginning this project.
