# VERY IMPORTANT NOTE
I am not a financial expert, I am doing this at my own risk using a strategy I develop. Please do not take my strategy or anything I say in the document(s) as advice. 

If you wish to invest, I encourage you to do your own research or speak to a professional. 

# Trading-Bot
My (probably poor) attempt at creating a trading bot. Primarily in python. I will do my best to document the code and keep it readble, although this is my first public project. 

# The Goal of this project
My goal in doing this project is to create a automatic trading bot, that can consistently return 5% on a monthly basis. I will not be options trading (yet) and will purely be buying and selling stocks.
