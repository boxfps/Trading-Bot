Step by step to riches!:
    1 - Pick a strategy [Done]
        - Flesh out strategy and test [2024-10-13]

    2 - Choose a market (I prefer TSX for taxation purposes)
        - Will be using TSX

    3- Select API's and other technologies (ensure they apply to the market you chose)

    4- Test strategy (do lots of research)

    5 - Risk management (dont gamble ur life savings)
        - Will be setting stop losses and take profits

    6 - Paper trading 

    7 - Once I have an established strategy automate it

    8 - Add Security for unathourized trades

Other notes:
    Log all trades for taxing purposes (in a .xlsx)
    Ensure strategy works on preferred stock exchange
    See step 6: might try to incorporate ML so it learns from paper trading?
    Pick a brokerage (I will likely choose Questtrade or Interactive Brokers), to execute trades
